# Hbase 
Hbase is db for hadoop. Hadoop is a big data processing framework bit not a db 

- Hive and HBase are both data stores for storing unstructured data. 

- HBase is a NoSQL database used for real-time data streaming whereas Hive is not ideally a database but a mapreduce based SQL engine that runs on top of hadoop. 

- Ideally comparing Hive vs. HBase might not be right because HBase is a database

- Hive is a SQL engine for batch processing of big data.
